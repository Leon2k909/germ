/**
 * Tapping a card offers the app's own language, or nothing at all.
 *
 * She asked for exactly two choices here: "no translation", and whatever
 * language the app is set to. The picker used to be driven by the course
 * instead — it offered any table that could read it — so an English app
 * offered German help to someone who may not read German, and a German app
 * offered English.
 *
 * This runs the real module rather than reading it, because the rule is a
 * relationship between three things (app language, course language, which
 * tables exist) and a regex over the source would pass while the behaviour
 * was wrong. Every combination is exercised.
