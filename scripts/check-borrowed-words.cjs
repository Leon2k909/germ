/**
 * A German word quoted in an English line is said in German — and nothing else is.
 *
 * "Der Kühlschrank. Der, not das!" and "Der, die or das?" are English
 * sentences with German words standing in them. Read by the English voice,
 * the card teaching the articles is the one mispronouncing them.
 *
 * The danger is entirely in the other direction. "die" is an ordinary English
 * word, and "to die", "one die", "die down" and "What did he die of?" are all
 * real cards in this course. A rule that went by spelling would say those in
 * German, which is a worse fault than the one it set out to fix — so this
 * checks the whole catalogue, not just the three cards it is meant to help.
 *
 * The rule under test has two parts: a word must appear on the card's own
 * German side, AND at least one such word must be unmistakably German. The
 * second part is what keeps "I am in the city" beside "Ich bin in der Stadt"
 * from turning its "in" German.
