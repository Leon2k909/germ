/**
 * A translation key that matches nothing is invisible.
 *
 * The card translations are keyed on the English source text, copied by hand
 * out of the course. One wrong character — a hyphen instead of an en dash, a
 * missing full stop — and the lookup silently misses. The card still renders,
 * the tap still works, and the learner is told there is no translation for a
 * card that was in fact translated. Nothing throws and nothing looks broken,
 * which is exactly the class of failure worth pinning.
 *
 * So: every key must correspond to a real card heading, card body or section
 * heading in the course. The reverse is NOT required — a partly translated
 * course is a legitimate state, and the interface says so per card.
