/**
 * Numbers must be written the way the INTERFACE language writes them.
 *
 * Number.toLocaleString() with no argument formats for the machine, not for
 * the app. On a German-region Windows every count in Micheon came out with
 * German separators no matter which language the app was set to, so an
 * English dashboard read "18.935 XP" — which an English reader parses as
 * eighteen point nine three five, off by a factor of a thousand. Sixty-seven
 * call sites did it, and none of them looked wrong in the source.
 *
 * uiNumber() exists for this. The rule is simply that the locale is never
 * left to chance: pass one, or use the helper that does.
