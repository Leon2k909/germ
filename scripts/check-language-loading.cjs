 * A language is downloaded by the people learning it, and nobody else.
 *
 * The translation tables are the biggest thing in the app that most learners
 * never need: French is 443 KB of source and Polish 474 KB, and there are 84
 * languages planned. They used to be two static imports in translations.ts,
 * which put every language into one chunk that the ENTRY chunk pulled in — so
 * a learner doing German alone downloaded all of them at startup, measured at
 * 786 KB, growing by roughly 450 KB with each one added.
 *
 * They are fetched on demand now. One line undoes that: a static import of a
 * table anywhere the app can reach turns it back into part of the bundle, and
 * nothing about the app looks different when it happens — it is simply slower
 * to start, for everyone, for ever.
 *
 * So this reads the built output rather than the intent. The entry chunk is
 * followed through its imports, and the tables must not be reachable from it.
