/**
 * Listen mode: passive exposure, deliberately NOT a lesson.
 *
 * Both languages are on screen and spoken together so the learner can be
 * doing something else entirely. That changes what a button press means:
 * recognising a sentence you HEAR, with its translation in front of you, is
 * a far weaker signal than producing it from memory in a guided session.
 * So the grades here are damped on purpose:
 *
 *  - "Know it" on a NEW item stamps listen counters only. It must not set a
 *    mastery grade, because a new item marked known would stop being
 *    introduced by Continue Learning — and the learner still needs to meet
 *    its spelling there. The tracker shows the exposure; the queue does not
 *    move.
 *  - "Know it" on a KNOWN item records a reinforcement — the same
 *    "practised again today, review date untouched" stamp optional practice
 *    uses. No rung climbed, no due date pushed.
 *  - "Difficult" on a NEW item marks a real struggle. That is not progress,
 *    it is a flag: guided sessions teach struggle-first, which is exactly
 *    what "I heard this and didn't get it" should cause.
 *  - "Difficult" on a KNOWN item keeps the ladder (one distracted listen
 *    must not undo months of reviews) but adds difficulty debt, the same
 *    signal a wrong answer leaves, so practice resurfaces it sooner.
