 * "wind" the verb, told apart from "wind" the weather.
 *
 * One spelling, two words: the breeze rhymes with tinned, winding something
 * up rhymes with mind, and the synthesiser has to guess from the sentence.
 * It guessed wrong on "things that wind me up", which came out as the
 * weather and left the line meaningless. Edge's endpoint rejects custom SSML,
 * so there is no phoneme tag to reach for — the lever available is the
 * spelling sent to it, and wynd is an ordinary English word with exactly the
 * sound wanted.
 *
 * Matched by construction rather than by guessing at the sense: the verb
 * takes an object and a particle (wind me up, wind it back down, wind down),
 * or the fixed "wind your neck in", or the hyphenated wind-up. The weather
 * never does — "the wind whistles up top" and "wind force eight" both stay as
 * they are, which is why the words allowed to sit between are listed rather
 * than left as "any two words".
