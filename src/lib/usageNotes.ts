/**
 * The little line under a card that says when to use it.
 *
 * Fourteen thousand of them, written in English because the app was written
 * in English. The app is written in six languages now, and every one of them
 * was showing this line in English: a Portuguese reader got the card in
 * Portuguese and the explanation of it in a language nobody promised them.
 *
 * They are not interface strings. An interface string is one of about three
 * thousand short labels that every screen needs; these are fourteen thousand
 * sentences that only the screens showing a card need, and only for the card
 * in front of you. Putting them in the interface tables would have tripled
 * what an app downloads to say "Weiter" in the right language.
 *
 * So they load like the interface tables and separately from them: one file
 * per language, fetched the first time a screen wants a note, and never at
 * all for a reader who stays in English. Until the file lands — and for any
 * note not yet in it — the English is shown, which is exactly what shipped
 * before this existed. Nothing is ever blank.
