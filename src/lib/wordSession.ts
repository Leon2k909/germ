/**
 * Vocabulary sittings: single words, taught on their own.
 *
 * The course has carried thousands of authored words with English glosses
 * since the beginning, and none of them was ever taught: words only entered lessons
 * through hand-written example sentences, and no word has one. That gate is
 * deliberate — an isolated word is not a sentence, and the sentence course
 * must never pad itself with flashcards. It stays. This module is the OTHER
 * door: a sitting made only of words, started from its own button, tracked
 * under its own ids.
 *
 * ISOLATION IS THE CONTRACT HERE. Word progress lives under a `vw-` id
 * namespace that no sentence path constructs or looks up, so a word graded
 * here can never surface as a due review in a sentence sitting, and a
 * sentence grade can never mark a word learned. The only single words a
 * sentence sitting may contain remain the authored one-word PHRASES —
 * "Prost!", "Genau!" — which are sentences by intent: things you say on
 * their own.

 * written in — so by word 2,450 of Listen the queue was serving der Aimbot,

 * words in exactly the order they were in — their rank already separates
 * them — and gives the other 4,915 the only real ordering they have: A1

 *
 * The corpus spread barely improves on no signal, which is the surprise:
 * counting how many packs use a word sounds like frequency and is mostly
 * noise. Occurrence count, computed and thrown away until now, adds a little
 * inside a rung. (Measured with the rung computed from the CEFR level only —
 * wordLadderRung consults the frequency bank for the A1-B1 mass, and letting

 * mean words go missing, only that they wait.
 *
