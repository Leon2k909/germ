 * The interface tables, fetched when the interface is in that language.

 * English is the source key, so an English app needs no table at all — and it
 * used to download every other language's anyway. Both tables were static
 * imports and landed in a chunk the entry pulls in: 235 KB of German and
 * 227 KB of French, on every start, for a reader using neither. With more
 * interface languages coming, that grows by roughly 230 KB each.
 *
 * ui() is called from render and stays synchronous. A table not yet here
 * gives the English key back, which is what a missing string already did —
 * so the failure mode is unchanged, and main.tsx waits for the table before
 * the first render so nobody sees it.
 *
 * Both tables live in their own files for this reason. German was written
 * inline here, which meant it loaded with ui() — and ui() is imported by every
 * screen there is, so there was no arrangement of chunks that could leave it
 * out. Moving it was the whole fix; nothing about the entries changed.
