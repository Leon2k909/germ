/**
 * Tap a card, read it in your own language.
 *
 * The only help on offer is the app's own language, and the only other
 * choice is none. It used to be independent of the interface language, on
 * the reasoning that someone might run the app in English and still want
 * German help. In practice that produced the opposite: an English app
 * offering a German translation to someone who may not read a word of
 * German, and a German app offering English. The language you set the app
 * to is already your statement of what you read, so it decides this too.
 *
 * It still defaults to "off" — help is offered, never imposed — and it is
 * still stored separately, so turning it off does not disturb the interface.
 *
 * Adding a language is one file and two lines: export a Record<string, string>
 * keyed on the SOURCE text, and register it in TRANSLATIONS below. The keys
 * are the course's own strings exactly as they appear in it, so a missing
 * entry degrades to showing the original rather than to a crash or an empty
 * panel.
 *
 * A table also says which language it translates FROM. Country studies holds
 * seven courses written in seven languages: Life in the UK is English, Leben
 * in Deutschland is German, Vivre en France is French, and the four newer
 * ones are Polish, Italian, Spanish and Russian. Without "from", the picker
 * would offer a German learner a German translation of German cards and
 * appear broken. A target language can read more than one of them, so
 * "from" is a LIST rather than a single language.
 *
 * The tables for one target language are merged into one lookup, because a
 * table is keyed by its course's own source text and two courses written in
 * two different languages cannot produce the same key. check-fr-translations
 * fails the build if they ever do.
