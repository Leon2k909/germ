              Skip used to sit beside Try again, directly under a panel that had
              just printed the sentence. So the cheapest way through a sentence
              you could not write was to read it and press the other button —
              and the one thing the stage exists to make you do, produce it, was
              the one thing you could decline. The closed-book recall stages
              never offered that; this brings the production stages into line.

              Nothing here is a trap. The answer is on screen, the grader
              forgives spelling and phrasing, the accent row supplies the
              characters, and the session's own exit is still a press away — so
              what is being asked for is a copy, which is the repair.

                  was a plural in the placeholder — the shape of the answer

                  Enter moves to the next empty box first and only checks
