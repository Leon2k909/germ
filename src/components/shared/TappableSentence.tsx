/**
 * A sentence you can take apart a word at a time.
 *
 * Tap a word to hear it on its own; rest on it and a popover gives the
 * meaning, a pronoun note where one helps, and the two things a learner
 * actually wants next — hear it again, or keep it. Reading a line you nearly
 * understand and being stuck on one word is the most common way to stall, and
 * both ways out are bad: give up on the line, or leave the app for a
 * dictionary. This answers it in place and leaves the rest of the sentence to
 * be worked out, which is the part that teaches.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in the lesson because every surface that shows a
 * German sentence wants it — the lesson, Listen, and the passages — and a
 * second copy would drift. A plain tooltip was tried in Listen first and was
 * the wrong thing: it could tell you what a word meant and then leave you with
 * nowhere to put it.
